# hackemulator

Emulates the Hack CPU platform from nand2tetris. The emulator features a background compilation: press Ctrl-C after loading a ROM or ASM file to achieve maximum speed.

In order to be able to limit the speed, compile with Ctrl-Shift-C and then set the desired MHz in the menu or via the slider.

Source code to be published in due course.
